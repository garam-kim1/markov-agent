Perform a git commit with the following logic:

1. SILENTLY analyze `git status`, `git diff`, and `git log -n 5`.
2. Stage relevant changes.
3. Generate a concise, descriptive commit message based on context and '{{args}}'.
4. Execute `git commit -m "<message>"`.

Do not explain your steps. Just execute and show the result of the commit command.
