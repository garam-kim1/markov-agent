Follow this workflow to process coding instructions:

1. **Analyze & Research**:
   - Carefully analyze the provided instruction.
   - Use `google_web_search` to verify if the instructions (e.g., library usage, API calls, technical concepts) are accurate and up-to-date.
   - If the instruction seems based on hallucinations or outdated information, explain why and ask for clarification.

2. **Plan**:
   - If verified, create a detailed implementation plan.
   - Mimic the project's existing style, structure, and conventions.

3. **Implement**:
   - Modify or create source code files.
   - Add comprehensive tests for the new functionality.

4. **Verify**:
   - Run the project's verification suite:
     - `uv run ruff check --fix`
     - `uv run ruff format`
     - `uvx ty check`
     - `uv run pytest`
   - Fix any issues that arise during verification.

5. **Finalize**:
   - Provide a summary of the changes and the verification results.
