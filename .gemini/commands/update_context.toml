description = "Regenerate GEMINI.md to provide an optimized, token-efficient context for LLM agents."
prompt = """
Update `GEMINI.md` to serve as a high-density technical context for LLM agents. 

1. **Project Essence**: 1-2 sentences on core philosophy (Markov Agents, Stochastic PPUs).
2. **Tech Stack**: Strict constraints (Python 3.12+, uv, ruff, pytest, ty, pydantic v2, google-adk).
3. **Architecture**: FSM/Topology paradigm (State, Graph, Node/PPU, Edge).
4. **Directory Map**: Deep-scan `src/markov_agent/`. For each module, list key files and 3-5 word explanations of their role.
5. **Coding Rules**: Mandatory patterns (ADKConfig, explicit constructors, async, event-driven) and FORBIDDEN (print, magic strings, sync LLM).
6. **Token Efficiency**: Use abbreviations and concise technical language. No conversational filler or human-centric readability fluff.

Goal: Provide a complete, compact operational manual for an agent to work on this repo with minimal token overhead.
